# rdio-black

rdio on your Xbox One without burning your plasma in

Xbox One unfortunately doesn't have an rdio app and the only way to use it
is in a web browser. The browser will only play the music from your current
tab, forcing you to stay on rdio if you want to keep playing.

rdio uses bright colors and if your plasma is exposed to it long
enough the interface will "burn in".

The solution is simple. Have rdio open in a frame inside an all-black page that's
long enough, so that you can scroll past it. Switching rdio interface on and off
is just scrolling.
